# MusicGenreML
A machine learning project that classifies music into various genres using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project leverages the GTZAN dataset and pre-trained models to predict music genres based on audio features.

## How To Use

### 1. CNN_Using_PreModel.py
Use this Python file to make genre predictions on audio files (MP3 or WAV format).  
*Note:* The required pre-trained model file is already included in this repository.

### 2. Model Training

#### Dataset_Preparation.py
This script extracts the necessary features from the music files. Before running it, you'll need to download the *GTZAN* dataset and set the DATASET_PATH variable to point to the correct directory where the dataset is stored.

#### CNN_Network.py
Once youâ€™ve prepared the dataset (via Dataset_Preparation.py), use this script to train the neural network. It will generate and export the trained model in JSON format.
